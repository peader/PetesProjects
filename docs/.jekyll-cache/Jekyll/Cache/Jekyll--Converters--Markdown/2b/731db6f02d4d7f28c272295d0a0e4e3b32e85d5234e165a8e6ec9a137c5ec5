I"Õ<p>I‚Äôve been meaning to try out the very cool <a href="https://stereokit.net/">StereoKit</a> on my Oculus device for a while now. As of yet there isn‚Äôt a ready made Visual Studio Template for creatiing and deploying to Android devices like there is for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NickKlingensmith.StereoKitTemplates">Hololens and UWP</a> devices.
I could just be patient and wait for Nick and the team to release the Android template or‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I could try build the source code and example android project there in :).
Ok, here we go:
1) First off Ensure you have the Xamarin workload from Visual Studio 2019 installed:
	- Open the Visual Studio Installer and click modify on your Visual Studio 2019 installation.
	- Select the ‚ÄúMobile development with .Net‚Äù workload and ‚ÄúMobile development with c++‚Äù.	
2) Since I‚Äôm going to try and build the stereokit example from scratch I need to have a few additional tools installed and configured:
	- The <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads">android NDK</a> 
		- Once downloaded you can extract the folder to a convenient location.
	- xmake installed on my windows machine.
		- You can either install via powershell
		<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">powershell
			Invoke-Expression (Invoke-Webrequest 'https://xmake.io/psget.text' -UseBasicParsing).Content
		</code>
		- Or install using the windows exe from the <a href="https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/releases">xmake release page</a></p>
