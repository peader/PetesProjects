title: Cutting through the cruft!

So living in Germany you tend to accumulate a fair amount of documentation. What's worse is that it all could be potentially important to some future beaurocratic process. I wanted to make the archiving of these documents digital and searchable.
I haven't really found any android application out there that does what I want so here I go down the road of trying to build my own.
I want to see if I can leverage my dotnet knowledge and build a cross platform C# based application using the brand new .MAUI framework.
Let's see how it goes :)
