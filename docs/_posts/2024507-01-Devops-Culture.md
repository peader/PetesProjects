## Foreword
I have worked in software development for over 10 years and in that time have always been drawn towards devops related tasks. It is only in the last 2 years that I've held the title "Devops Engineer". I wanted to find the reason why I am drawn to this area of software development and what it even brings, in terms of value, to the teams and business' who are supposed to benefit from it. The following blog post is my attempt to answer these questions. These are just my opinions and are heavily influenced by the books: "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim and John Willis, and "Flow" by Mihaly Csikyentmihaly.

- Value stream
- feedback
- experiments and learning

autonomy, agency and impact
