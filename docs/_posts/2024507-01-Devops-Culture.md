## Foreword
I have worked in software development for over 10 years and in that time have always been drawn towards devops related tasks. It is only in the last 2 years that I've held the title "Devops Engineer". I wanted to find the reason why I am drawn to this area of software development and what it even brings, in terms of value, to the teams and business' who are supposed to benefit from it. The following blog post is my attempt to answer these questions. These are just my opinions and are heavily influenced by the books: "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim and John Willis, and "Flow" by Mihaly Csikyentmihaly.

Originally, when someone asked me what the goal of devops was I would have answered "To enable  the development teams to more effectively deliver software". Although I still thing this is important it hides, at least it did for me, the wider context of what it takes to make a development team more effective. I would inevitably end up focusing on developer tooling and pipeline automization. Don't get me wrong, these are worthwhile areas to work on but, as I mentioned, are not always the ones that yield the greatest benefit. So how do we figure out what we should work on really have an impact as a devops engineer?
For this it is important to understand the entire process of software development. From planning all the way through to delivery. In the Phoenix Project this "flow" of work is called the value stream.
