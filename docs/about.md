I'm a Devops engineer with several years experience as a software engineer. This gives me a unique perspective into the needs of my software developer colleagues. Where possible I use industry standard tools to deploy, monitor, orchestrate and document our software solutions and processes. If those tools don't exist or need customization I have no problem rolling up my sleeves and programming something new be it in python, go, c#, bash or powershell.
I'll make it work and make it maintainable.
